  "query": "A 5-man group made up of one tank, one healer, and three DPS is doing a dungeon that was just released in World of Warcraft. Two are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers. At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS. A bear from the group is attacking the boss. Metamorphosis is cast. The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it. If all classes were using their class abilities and all classes are unique, what are the five classes in the group in alphabetical order separated by commas?",
