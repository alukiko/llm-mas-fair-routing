If another species observed Earth to search for life, they'd look for \"smoking gun\" chemistry in the atmosphere. That includes looking for oxygen, since it is created through photosynthesis by plants and some bacteria. So, the key is to look for life-dependent chemical \"signals\" at exoplanets.

Most of them date back at least to the formation of the Galaxy.\n\nAstronomers used the Canada-France-Hawai'i telescope in Hawaii to study a selection of these stars.
