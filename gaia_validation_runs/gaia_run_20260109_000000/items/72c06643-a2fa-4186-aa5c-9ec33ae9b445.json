When dealing with ocean temperatures it's important to recognize that water temperature generally decreases as you move into deeper water.\n\nThe relatively warm surface water of oceans like the Pacific Ocean extends to depths of between 500 and 1,000 feet. Below the surface waters, the temperature drops rapidly, forming a layer called the thermocline.\n\nThe thermocline varies in thickness from about 1,000 feet to 3,000 feet. Below this point water cools more slowly, primarily because currents are much reduced at that "

The pressure at that point is 15,750 psi (pounds per square inch). I used this handy little calculator ( to determine that water would boil at 493 degrees C (919 degrees F). By comparison, Mt.
